In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis."

    "\n",
    "The data we're working with was sampled at the moments we want: one sample was taken previous to the analysis, and the other after the analysis. We want to describe the population, so we need to make sure that the samples are representative, otherwise we should expect a large sampling error and, ultimately, wrong conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Hickey's article and from the README.md of the data set's repository, we can see that he used the following sampling criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie must have had at least 30 fan ratings on Fandango's website at the time of sampling (Aug. 24, 2015).\n",
    "The movie must have had tickets on sale in 2015.\n",
    "The sampling was clearly not random because not every movie had the same chance to be included in the sample â€” some movies didn't have a chance at all (like those having under 30 fan ratings or those without tickets on sale in 2015). It's questionable whether this sample is representative of the entire population we're interested to describe. It seems more likely that it isn't, mostly because this sample is subject to temporal trends â€” e.g. movies in 2015 might have been outstandingly good or bad compared to other years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling conditions for our other sample were (as it can be read in the README.md of the data set's repository):\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie must have been released in 2016 or later.\n",
    "The movie must have had a considerable number of votes and reviews (unclear how many from the README.md or from the data).\n",
    "This second sample is also subject to temporal trends and it's unlikely to be representative of our population of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these authors had certain research questions in mind when they sampled the data, and they used a set of criteria to get a sample that would fit their questions. Their sampling method is called purposive sampling (or judgmental/selective/subjective sampling). While these samples were good enough for their research, they don't seem too useful for us."

    "Although one of the sampling criteria in our second sample is movie popularity, the sample doesn't provide information about the number of fan ratings. We should be skeptical once more and ask whether this sample is truly representative and contains popular movies (movies with over 30 fan ratings).\n",
    "\n",
